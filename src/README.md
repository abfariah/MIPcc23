### Activate conda env

My mipcomp.sh file can be called from the src directory.   
First, as conda environment is used for python dependencies management, the command :
```python
conda activate bb4
```


muste be run.    

### Evaluation
Then, to evaluate for instance the script on obj 2 series, one could run :

```python
sh mipcomp.sh home/paul/MIPcc23/datasets/testfiles/obj_series_2.test
```

Of course, any other absolute path to a ``series.test`` file can be provided.
